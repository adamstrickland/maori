<h1>Kiwi Grove's Maori</h1>
<p>Maori is an open-source personal portfolio page.</p>

<p>You make awesome code, but need a portfolio website. The only problem is your a developer, not a designer. That's where Maori comes in. By forking this project and changing editing a few lines of code, you have a sexy site and can go back to your code zone.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>Fork this project and upload to wherever you want to use it. Everything is done in HTML and CSS with nothing else needed.</p>

<h2>index.html</h2>
<p>Here is where your going to change all your personal information, change the title to your name, change links, just edit the HTML and make it work.</p>

<h2>Fonts</h2>
<p>To get sweet custom fonts go to <a href="http://code.google.com/webfonts">Google</a> or <a href="http://typekit.com">Typekit</a>.

<h2>custom.css</h2>
<p>You can completely customize the entire site to make your own flavor by editing 3 CSS variables, content background color, link color, and font family.</p>

<h2>background.jpg</h2>
<p>Find a picture that makes you look awesome, then export it so that the width is 1280px. Overwrite the default picture and your good to go.</p>
